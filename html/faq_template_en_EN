<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>How can I send a copy to the User?</h2>
Add a field [wcf.email] as an email input filed to your form. If the user
fills in his email, the plugin will send a copy of the word file to that Email address.

<h2>I have changed my form a little bit, but the resulting form hasn't change. Why?</h2>


If you use the code of your form, your form is always up to date. But if you've 
created a wordpress page one time and change something, you have to create a new
wordpress page. Also keep in mind to update all links to that page.


<h2>Is it possible to change the redirection URL?</h2>


You find the input field for your redirection URL under Settings->Form Data.
There are also two checkboxes to append all input fields to the redirection url. So you can create
multilevel input forms.


<h2>The input field mapping of the data table isn't correct, what can I do?</h2>


WpCoolForm is very flexible, you can allways change the Form Name, also you can change field names, types,
you can add and delete fields everytime. Normally this works fine. We suggest not to delete fields if user inputs
already exists. You may loose these inputs as well. On the other hand adding new fields is allways possible.


<h2>What about Captchas?</h2>


You have two options:
<ul>
<li> Use our inbuild captcha by selecting the checkbox under Settings.
<li> use reCaptcha. Therefore you need to register at Google. The secret keys you can cut/paste under Settings.
</ul>
Our Captcha has two modi. If you have installed a graphical library, every captcha-image is generated
on the fly. If you don't, we use an existing image which displays a number between 1 and 100.
